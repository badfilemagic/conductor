<p>Many test frameworks exist to test code on a single host or, across a
network, on a single server.  Conductor is a distributed system test
framework, written in Python, that can be used to coordinate a set of
tests among a set of clients.  The Conductor system allows a single
machine to control several systems, orchestrating tests that require
the cooperation of several networked devices.</p>

<p>A common use for Conductor is to test a network devices, such as a
router or firewall, that is connected to multiple senders and
receivers.  Each of the senders, receivers, and the device under test
(DUT) are a Player, and another system is designated as the Conductor.</p>

<p>The players, read commands over a network channel, execute them and
return results to the conductor.</p>

<p>The conductor reads test descriptions from a configuration file,
written using Python's config parser, and executes the tests on the
players.</p>

<p>The tests are executed in Phases.  A Phase contains a set of internal
or external (shell/program) commands that are executed in order, per
client.  The four Phases currently defined are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Startup</li>
</ul><p>The startup phase is where commands that are required to set up each
device are execute.  Examples include setting up network interfaces,
routing tables, as well as creating directories to hold result files
on the players.</p>

<ul>
<li>Run</li>
</ul><p>The Run phase contains the commands that are the core of the test.  An
example might be starting a number of transmitting and receiving
programs to generate and sink traffic through the DUT.</p>

<ul>
<li>Collect</li>
</ul><p>In the Collect phase the Conductor sends commands to the Players to
retrieve any data that was generated during the test, and places that
data into a results directory on the Conductor, for later analysis.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reset</li>
</ul><p>The last phase is the Reset phase, where the Conductor instructs the
Players to reset any configuration that might have been set in the
Startup phase and which might influence later test runs.  It is the
goal when writing Conductor tests that all the systems used in the
test return to the state they were in prior to the Startup phase.</p>

<p>Each Phase has three parts.  The Conductor first downloads the Phase to
the Player, but does not tell it to execute.  Downloading the Phase to
each client allows the Conductor to start each Phase nearly
simultaneously, although the fact that the Conductor itself serializes
its communication among the clients means that there is a small amount
of skew in when each Player is told to execute its steps.  </p>
